### What I learned

This challenge helped reinforce several key concepts in front-end development:
Structuring semantic HTML
Using Flexbox for vertical and horizontal alignment
Creating responsive card components
Applying box-shadow, border-radius, and spacing effectively

### Challenges Faced
A specific issue I encountered was styling the "Learning" label (with the .target class). Originally, I used a <p> element which caused the background color to span the entire line, rather than just wrapping the text. After some debugging, I replaced the <p> with a <span> and used the display: inline-block property. This allowed the yellow background to wrap snugly around the text, resulting in a pill-shaped badge â€” exactly what the design called for.

This was a great reminder of how choosing the right HTML element and display property is essential for achieving precise visual results.
